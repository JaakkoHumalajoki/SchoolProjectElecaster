# 0xc0ff3e sofware designs project - *name placeholder*

This is Tampere University course COMP.SE.110-2020-2021-1 Software Design course repository.

## The assignment

The assignment is defined as follows:

> In this project, the student groups will design and implement a piece of software for monitoring electricity consumption in parallel with weather forecast. How much electricity is used has a lot to do with the weather â€“ in addition to simply cranking up the heat when the weather is cold, also windy weather will often lead to adjusting the heating. Additionally, there are nowadays several power sources (solar power, wind power) that directly depend on the weather.
